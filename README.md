Big Data Analysis: Airport Data Processing ✈️
Project Overview
This project performs Big Data analysis on an airport dataset containing one million records. The goal is to process and analyze large-scale aviation data efficiently, applying various data manipulation techniques.

Features & Operations
✅ Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, outlier detection, and formatting inconsistencies.
✅ Data Transformation: Filtering, aggregating, and restructuring data for meaningful insights.
✅ Statistical Analysis: Extracting key metrics related to flights, passengers, and delays.
✅ Visualization: Generating insightful plots to represent trends in airport operations.
✅ Performance Optimization: Applying efficient techniques to handle large datasets.

Technologies Used
Python 🐍

Pandas for data manipulation

NumPy for numerical computations

Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization

PySpark (if used for scalability)
